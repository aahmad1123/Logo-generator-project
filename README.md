# Logo-generator-project
Generates a .svg file logo through the command line interface using node.js. I worked on this project with my tutor, Robert Kurle Jr., on March 4th, 2024. First I worked on setting up the inquirer questions in the index.js file that would feed data into the generation function. Then we created the parent shape class and children circle triangle and square classes in shapes.js that would render the image for us. Then we imported the objects and destructured them back in index.js and created if-then statements handling the variable choices for object shape. Finally we created the svgtag class that used the imported render function from shapes.js that would take in data from inquirer and used it in the write file function to output the logo.
